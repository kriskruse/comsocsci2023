[Before week 1](https://nbviewer.org/github/lalessan/comsocsci2023/blob/master/lectures/Before_week_1.ipynb). Take a look at this page before you do anything. This class most likely works a little bit differently from other classes you've taken. The notebook explains pretty much everything - the rest will be explained during the lectures. In case the link doesn't work, you can also see the file [here](https://github.com/lalessan/comsocsci2022/blob/master/lectures/Before_week_1.ipynb) on Github, but the videos won't display properly


[Week 1: Intro to Computational Social Science](https://nbviewer.org/github/lalessan/comsocsci2023/blob/master/lectures/Week1.ipynb). This week is all about getting started: learning about how the course works, make sure you master the tools you need to follow the class. I will give you an introduction to the field of Computational Social Science. And, we will start with something hands-on: you will learn about web-scraping and start gathering some data from the web.

 * __Reading__: [Bit by Bit, chapter 1](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/introduction/) Start by reading the Introduction of the book, where you will get you an understanding of the history of the field and the general framework.    

 * __Reading__:  [Bit by Bit, chapter 6](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/ethics/) Read the Ethics chapter of the book. Here, I don't expect you to read all the details. However, I want to make sure you get an overall understanding of the ethical challenges and some of the approaches that are used in the field to deal with these complex issues. You can focus on sections 6.4 and 6.6.    

[Week 2: Data 1 - Gathering data](https://nbviewer.org/github/lalessan/comsocsci2023/blob/master/lectures/Week2.ipynb) This week we will learn more about data sources for Computational Social Science. First you will learn about different data types by listening to some theory and reading the book. Then we will move on to do something practical: you will learn about APIs to collect data and use them to gather some (actually a lot!) of data.

 * __Reading__: [Bit by Bit, sections 2.1 to 2.3](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/observing-behavior/observing-intro/) Read sections 2.1 to 2.3. The idea is for you to understand, in general terms, advantages and challenges of large observational datasets (a.k.a. Big Data) for social studies.

 [Week 3: Data 2 - Distributions in empirical data](https://nbviewer.org/github/lalessan/comsocsci2023/blob/master/lectures/Week3.ipynb) This week we will focus on two topics. First, we will talk about how to effectively use _data visualization_ techniques as a tool to analyse empirical data. Then, you will learn about heavy tailed distribution, which are common in many real-world social datasets. You will hear some theory and put things into practice through exercises.

  * __Reading__: [Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipfâ€™s law](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6241/2019sp/readings/Newman-2005-distributions.pdf) Read the introduction and skim through the rest of the article.    


[Week 4: Networks 1 - Building the Network](https://nbviewer.org/github/lalessan/comsocsci2023/blob/master/lectures/Week4.ipynb) Today we learn about networks and how we can use them to understand social systems. We will start from the theory. There will be some video lectures + some reading, where we'll answer some important questions, such as "Why would anyone care about networks" and "How can you use Python to study networks". Then, we will put the learning into practice. We will build the social network of Computational Social Scientists and run some initial analyses.
 * __Reading__: [Chapters 1 and 2 of the Network Science book](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/1)
